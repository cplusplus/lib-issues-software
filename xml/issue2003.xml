<p>
Clause 21.4.1 [string.require]p3 states:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
No <tt>erase()</tt> or <tt>pop_back()</tt> member function shall throw
any exceptions.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
However in 21.4.6.5 [string::erase] p2 the first version of <tt>erase</tt> has
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Throws</i>: <tt>out_of_range</tt> if <tt>pos > size()</tt>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
Beman: Don't want to just change this, can we just say "unless otherwise specified"?
<p/>
Alisdair: Leave open, but update proposed resolution to say something like "unless otherwise specified".
<p/>
General agreement that it should be corrected but not a stop-ship.
<p/>
Action: Update proposed wording for issue 2003 as above, but leave Open.

Jeffrey: Madrid meeting's proposed wording wasn't applied, and it's better than the original proposed wording.
However, this sentence is only doing 3 functions' worth of work, unlike the similar paragraphs in <sref ref="[container.requirements.general]"/>.
Suggest just putting "<i>Throws:</i> Nothing" on the 3 functions.

<resolution>
<p>
Remove [string.require]p/3:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<del>3 No <tt>erase()</tt> or <tt>pop_back()</tt> member function shall throw any exceptions.</del>
</p></blockquote>

<p>
Add to the specifications of <tt>iterator erase(const_iterator p);</tt>, <tt>iterator erase(const_iterator first, const_iterator last);</tt>,
 and <tt>void pop_back();</tt> in <sref ref="[string::erase]"/>:
</p>
<blockquote><p><ins><i>Throws:</i> Nothing</ins></p></blockquote>
</resolution>

</issue>
