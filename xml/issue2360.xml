<p>
Previously, C++03 24.4.1.3.3 [lib.reverse.iter.op.star] required:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
reference operator*() const;
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Effects</i>: 
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
Iterator tmp = current;
return *--tmp;
</pre></blockquote>
</blockquote></blockquote>
<p>
Now, N3797 24.5.1.1 [reverse.iterator] depicts:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
private:
  Iterator deref_tmp; // exposition only
};
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
And 24.5.1.3.4 [reverse.iter.op.star] requires:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
reference operator*() const;
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Effects</i>: 
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
deref_tmp = current;
--deref_tmp;
return *deref_tmp;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
[<i>Note</i>: This operation must use an auxiliary member variable rather than a temporary variable to avoid 
returning a reference that persists beyond the lifetime of its associated iterator. (See 24.2.) &mdash; <i>end note</i>]
</p>

<p>
As written, this won't compile, because <tt>operator*()</tt> is <tt>const</tt> yet it's modifying (via assignment and decrement) 
the <tt>deref_tmp</tt> data member. So what happens if you say "<tt>mutable Iterator deref_tmp;</tt>"?
<p/>
DANGER: WARP CORE BREACH IMMINENT.
<p/>
The Standard requires <tt>const</tt> member functions to be callable from multiple threads simultaneously. This is 
<sref ref="[res.on.data.races]"/>/3: "A C++ standard library function shall not directly or indirectly modify objects (1.10) 
accessible by threads other than the current thread unless the objects are accessed directly or indirectly via the function's 
non-const arguments, including <tt>this</tt>."
<p/>
Multiple threads simultaneously modifying <tt>deref_tmp</tt> will trigger data races, so both <tt>mutable</tt> and some form of 
synchronization (e.g. <tt>mutex</tt> or <tt>atomic</tt>) are actually necessary!
<p/>
Here's what implementations currently do: Dinkumware/VC follows C++03 and doesn't use <tt>deref_tmp</tt> (attempting to 
implement it is what led me to file this issue). According to Jonathan Wakely, libstdc++ also follows C++03 (see 
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/PR51823">PR51823</a> which is suspended until LWG <iref ref="2204"/> is resolved). According to 
Marshall Clow, libc++ uses <tt>deref_tmp</tt> with <tt>mutable</tt> but without synchronization, so it can trigger data races.
<p/>
This <tt>deref_tmp</tt> Standardese was added by LWG <iref ref="198"/> "Validity of pointers and references unspecified after 
iterator destruction" and is present in Working Papers going back to <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2004/n1638.pdf">N1638</a> 
on April 11, 2004, long before C++ recognized the existence of multithreading and developed the "<tt>const</tt> means simultaneously 
readable" convention.
<p/>
A related issue is LWG <iref ref="1052"/> "<tt>reverse_iterator::operator-&gt;</tt> should also support smart pointers" which 
mentioned the need to depict <tt>mutable</tt> in the Standardese, but it was resolved NAD Future and no change was made.
<p/>
Finally, LWG <iref ref="2204"/> "<tt>reverse_iterator</tt> should not require a second copy of the base iterator" talked about 
removing <tt>deref_tmp</tt>, but without considering multithreading.
<p/>
I argue that <tt>deref_tmp</tt> must be removed. Its existence has highly undesirable consequences: either no synchronization 
is used, violating the Standard's usual multithreading guarantees, or synchronization is used, adding further costs for all 
users that benefit almost no iterators.
<p/>
<tt>deref_tmp</tt> is attempting to handle iterators that return references to things "inside themselves", which I usually call 
"stashing iterators" (as they have a secret stash). Note that these are very unusual, and are different from proxy iterators like 
<tt>vector&lt;bool&gt;::iterator</tt>.  While <tt>vector&lt;bool&gt;::iterator</tt>'s <tt>operator*()</tt> does not return a true 
reference, it refers to a bit that is unrelated to the iterator's lifetime.

<resolution>
<p>This wording is relative to N3797.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Change class template <tt>reverse_iterator</tt> synopsis, <sref ref="[reverse.iterator]"/>, as indicated:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
[&hellip;]
protected:
  Iterator current;
<del>private:
  Iterator deref_tmp; // exposition only</del>
};
</pre></blockquote>
</li>

<li><p>Change <sref ref="[reverse.iter.op.star]"/> as indicated:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
reference operator*() const;

-2- [<i>Note</i>: <del>This operation must use an auxiliary member variable rather than a temporary variable to
