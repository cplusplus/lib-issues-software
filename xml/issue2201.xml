It seems that in <sref ref="[diff.library]"/>, Table 150 the following macros from <sref ref="[c.limits]"/>, Table 31 
are missing:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
LLONG_MIN 
LLONG_MAX
ULLONG_MAX
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
In addition in <sref ref="[diff.library]"/>, Table 150 the following macros from <sref ref="[c.limits]"/>, Table 32 
are missing:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
DECIMAL_DIG 
FLT_EVAL_METHOD
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Furtheron it seems that in <sref ref="[diff.library]"/>, Table 149/150 further macros are missing as well, e.g. 
<tt>HUGE_VALF</tt>, <tt>INFINITY</tt>, etc.
</p>

<p>
This is an issue, all of C has not been updated for C99, C99 functions are missing, whole section needs to be overhauled.
<p/>
The issue needs to be updated for functions and other missing items and when that happens the issue title is wrong and
needs to be adapted.
