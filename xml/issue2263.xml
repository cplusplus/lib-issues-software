<p>
This ancient issue <iref ref="179"/> says one ought to be able to compare iterators with <tt>const_iterators</tt> 
from any given container.  I'm having trouble finding words that guarantee this in C++11.  This impacts not only a 
container's iterators, but also the allocator requirements in <sref ref="allocator.requirements]"/> surrounding 
<tt>pointer</tt>, <tt>const_pointer</tt>, <tt>void_pointer</tt> and <tt>const_void_pointer</tt>.  E.g. can one 
compare a <tt>pointer</tt> with a <tt>const_pointer</tt>? 
<p/>
Since <tt>allocator::pointer</tt> and <tt>const_pointer</tt> are required to be random access iterators, one could 
expect that the <iref ref="179"/> guarantees apply for them as well.

<p>
The wording for <iref ref="179"/> was part of several working drafts (e.g. also in 
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2010/n3092.pdf">N3092</a>) over some time and suddenly got lost
in <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2011/n3242.pdf">N3242</a>, presumably by accident. Whatever we
decide for allocator pointers, I expect that we need to restore the  <iref ref="179"/> wording as part of the overall resolution:
</p>

<p>Reinsert after <sref ref="[container.requirements]"/> p6:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
-6- <tt>begin()</tt> returns an iterator referring to the first element in the container. <tt>end()</tt> returns an iterator which
is the past-the-end value for the container. If the container is empty, then <tt>begin() == end()</tt>;
<p/>
<ins>-?- In the expressions</ins>
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
<ins>i == j
i != j
i &lt; j
i &lt;= j
i &gt;= j
i &gt; j
i - j</ins>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
<ins>where <tt>i</tt> and <tt>j</tt> denote objects of a container's <tt>iterator</tt> type, either or both may be replaced by an object 
of the container's <tt>const_iterator</tt> type referring to the same element with no change in semantics.</ins>
</p>

<note>2014-02-13 Issaquah, Daniel comments and suggests wording</note>

<p>
First, I didn't originally move the seemingly lost wording to the resolution section because I wanted to ensure that the 
committee double-checks the reason of this loss. 
<p/>
Second, albeit restoring this wording will restore the comparability of <tt>const_iterator</tt> and <tt>iterator</tt> of
containers specified in Clause 23, but this alone would <em>not</em> imply that this guarantee automatically extends to
<em>all other</em> iterators, simply because there is no fundamental relation between a mutable iterator and a constant
iterator by itself. This relation only exists under specific conditions, for example for containers which provide two such
<tt>typedefs</tt> of that kind. Thus the wording restoration would <em>not</em> ensure that allocator <tt>pointer</tt> and 
<tt>const_pointer</tt> would be comparable with each other. To realize that, we would need additional guarantees added
to the allocator requirements. In fact, it is crucial to separate these things, because allocators are <em>not</em> 
restricted to be used within containers, they have their own legitimate use for other places as well (albeit containers
presumably belong to the most important use-cases), and this is also stated in the introduction of <sref ref="[allocator.requirements]"/>,
where it says:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
All of the string types (Clause 21), containers (Clause 23) (except array), string buffers and string streams (Clause 27), 
and <tt>match_results</tt> (Clause 28) are parameterized in terms of allocators.
